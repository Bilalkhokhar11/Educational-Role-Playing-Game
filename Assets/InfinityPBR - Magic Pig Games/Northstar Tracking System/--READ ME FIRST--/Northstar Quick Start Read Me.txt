Thanks for getting the Northstar Navigation System!

COMPASS OR RADAR
1. Select the menu option: Component/Northstar/Compass or Radar
2. Optionally dock the menu in your project.
3. Click a Compass or Radar prefab button to add it to your scene.

Note: If there is already one in the scene, it will be replaced, and the script will attempt to re-link any shard references.

SCREEN OVERLAY
1. Select the menu option: Component/Northstar/Screen Overlay
(That's it)

Note: If there is already one in the scene, it will be selected, and not replaced.
